#HOW TO THE DECLARE VARIABLES

#The first you will need to learn python is how to declare variables
x = 1
#First at all you will need to give a name to your variable, in the exemple above "x" is the name of the variable, and the signal "=" means that your variable
#will receive some value, so if "x = 1", the variable "x" receive the number one

#**ATTENTION: The variable name canÂ´t have space, start with numbers or special characters
